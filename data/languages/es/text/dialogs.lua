Had I only been able

Those culprits coaxed
me into revealing the

the Solarus children.
Protect them from all
danger, before
something dreadful
happens...
They are hiding in a
palace sitting east
of the mountains. The
eight Solarus beings
must escape from
Agahnim, else the
sorcerer could break
the seal created by
the Solarus Amulet, the
relic worn by Zelda,
necessary to the
gathering of the
Triforce shards.
The mystery of Solarus
is kept safe inside
the relic.
The relic's owner has
the ability to summon
the Solarus power to
seal an object, a
place or even a world,
as the seven sages once
did when they sealed
away the Golden Land.
Zelda is the heiress of
that power. She used it
to seal the Triforce
shards, using the eight
beings created by the
Solarus.
Thus, as long as she
alone knows the secret
of the relic, she alone
masters the Triforce's
seal. This is why you
must protect the seal.
